### Feedback

- This submission contains good READMEs and scripts.

- The parts are named wrong in this submission: -1pt
    - (Part 1 in the submission is part 2 in the assignment)

- Part 1: 
    - The README and scripts are good.

- Part 2:
    - The document describing the simple sorting application is very
      good.  All of the steps are clear.

- Part 3:
    - The introduction is good.
    - The graph visualization is less than ideal.  Having different
     experiments on the same line is a bit difficult to follow.
